This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

load dataset "iris"   
using ggplot2 to illustrate the database with respect to length and width of three plants


```{r}
attach(iris)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))
p + geom_point() + facet_grid(. ~ Species)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
