This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
with(trees, symbols(Height, Volume, circles= Girth/16, inches = FALSE, bg= "deeppink", fg= "gray30"))
```
 
```{r}
 with(ChickWeight, symbols(weight, Time, circles= Diet, inches=FALSE, bg= "blue", fg= "gray30"))
```


 It seems that the chicken who recieved a moderate diet grew to be the heaviest
