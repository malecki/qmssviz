hw4
on plunker, url goes below:

The three files are also downloaded and uploaded to my github as are under the branch hw4.

My personal webpage is www.columbia.edu/~sz2491, where I put my hw4 practice.

Setting personal website was inspired by Xiaoyao Yang, who presented his homework4 last class, but later I found Plunker might be more convenient.
