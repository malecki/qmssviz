This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df4 <- read.csv("lgas.csv")
sample_data <- read.csv("sample_health_facilities.csv")
subdf4 <- subset(df4, zone == "South-South")
df4merge <- merge(subdf4, sample_data, by.x = "lga_id", by.y = "lga_id")
orddf4mrg <- df4merge[order(df4merge$pop_2006),]
orddf4mrg

```

```{r}

subdf4.1 <- subset(df4, grepl("South", df4$zone))
df4merge.1 <- merge(subdf4.1, sample_data, by.x = "lga_id", by.y = "lga_id")
orddf4mrg.1 <- df4merge.1[order(df4merge.1$pop_2006),]
orddf4mrg.1

```
