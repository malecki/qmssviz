#4 Assignment

#Until tomorrow, please do the following activity:
#  1. Go to this link and download the file into the working directory.
#  2. Produce a new data.frame, which has the following properties:
#  - From the Nigeria Facilities Inventory data (sample_data from section 1.5.1), select all facilities located in the Southern zones of Nigeria.
#  - Incorporate the pop2006 column from the lgas.csv file into the new data.frame containing only those facilities located in Southern Nigeria. (Hint: your id column is lga_id).
#  - Calculate the total number of full time nurses and doctors for all health facilities in each state.
#  - Sort the resulting dataset by state population, in descending order.
#  - Show the results!
