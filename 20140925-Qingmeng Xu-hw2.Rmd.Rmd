This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (!require(plyr)) install.packages("plyr")
library(plyr)
if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
getwd()
setwd("/Users/ningmeng/Desktop")
file <-"lgas.csv"
lgas_data <- read.csv(file)
nigeria_data <- read.csv("sample_health_facilities.csv")
summary(sample_data$zone)
south <- subset(nigeria_data, nigeria$zone == "South-South" | nigeria$zone == "Southeast" | nigeria$zone == "Southwest")
lgas_pop <- lgas_data[，c(1，3)]
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
