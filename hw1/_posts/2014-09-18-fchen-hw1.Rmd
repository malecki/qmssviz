## Loading bboying injury data
The data used in the narrative below was obtained from the American Journal of Sports Medicine article, "Breakdance Injuries and Overuse Syndromes in Amateurs and Professionals," by Max Daniel Kauther. The sample size for the study was 144 bboys (breakdancers, 40 professional, 104 amateur).

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, comment = NA}
setwd("/Users/knarf/Copy/Datasets/bboy")
k1 <- read.table("kauther_t1.txt") 
k2 <- read.table("kauther_t2.txt") 
k3 <- read.table("kauther_t3.txt") 
k4 <- read.table("kauther_t4.txt") 
k5 <- read.table("kauther_t5.txt")
```

# Kauther's first table

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
height <- rbind(k1$amateur_mean, k1$prof_mean)
colnames(height) <- c("age", "bmi", "yr_dance", "hr/week_train", "min_warmup", "min_stretch", "headspin_train", "yr_headspin", "% use trainer", "doc-visit/person")
bar1 <- barplot(height, names.arg = colnames(height),
        main = "Professional vs. Amateur Bboys (Average Characteristics)", 
        xlab = "Mean Values (multiple)", 
        cex.names = 0.6, 
        cex.axis = 0.6, 
        las = 2, 
        xlim = c(0,80), 
        horiz = TRUE,
        width = 3,
        beside = TRUE,
        legend = TRUE
        )
text(height, bar1, label = height, pos = 4, cex = 0.65, col = "red")
```

This is a visual representation of the different characteristics of amateur and professional bboys. Some of these attributes include age, body mass index, minutes of warmup time, and time spent training headspins, all in their respective units.

## Kauther's second table

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
height2 <- rbind(k2$amateurs, k2$professionals)
colnames(height2) <- c("# of Injuries", "Injuries/bboy", "Hours/Injury", "# OVS", "OVS/bboy", "Hours/OVS")
bar2 <- barplot(height2, names.arg = colnames(height2), 
        main = "Professional vs. Amateur Bboys (Injuries & Overuse Syndrome (OVS))", 
        xlab = "Mean Values", 
        cex.names = 0.6, 
        cex.axis = 0.6, 
        las = 2, 
        xlim = c(0,2500), 
        horiz = TRUE,
        width = 3,
        beside = TRUE, 
        legend = TRUE,
        args.legend = list(x = "bottomright")
        )
text(height2, bar2, label = height2, pos = 4, cex = 0.65, col = "red")
```
On average, there are more injuries reported for amateur bboys compared to professional bboys, although more total injuries in amateurs may just be a result of a greater sample size. When adjusted on a per person basis, there are almost twice the number of injuries per bboy (16.1 injuries per professional versus 9.8 per amateur).

# Kauther's third table

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("lattice")
xyplot(k3$proff ~ k3$ama, groups = rownames(k3),
      ylim = c(0, 250),
      ylab = "Professional Injuries Count",
      xlim = c(0, 250),
      xlab = "Amateur Injuries Count",
      abline = c(0, 1),
      main = "Injuries Count by Region",
panel = function(x, y) {
      panel.xyplot(x, y, abline = c(0, 1), subscripts = TRUE, 
      groups = rownames(k3))
      ltext(x = k3$ama, y = k3$proff, labels = rownames(k3),
      pos = 4, cex = 0.8)
      })
      
xyplot(k3$proff_inj_pp ~ k3$ama_inj_pp, groups = rownames(k3),
       ylim = c(0, 4),
       ylab = "Professional Injuries per Person",
       xlim = c(0, 4),
       xlab = "Amateur Injuries per Person",
       abline = c(0, 1),
       main = "Injuries per Person by Region",
panel = function(x, y) {
      panel.xyplot(x, y, abline = c(0, 1), subscripts = TRUE, 
      groups = rownames(k3))
      ltext(x = k3$ama_inj_pp, y = k3$proff_inj_pp, 
      labels = rownames(k3), pos = 4, cex = 0.8)
      })
```

If we take a look at the injury counts between amateur and professional bboys, it appears that amateurs have a higher total injury count in almost all anatomical regions, with head injuries almost approaching a 1:1 ratio (amateur:professional). Normalizing for the difference between population count tells a different story. Injuries per professional bboy in all anatomical regions are higher than injuries per amateur bboy.

## Kauther's fourth table

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
bar5lab <- c("Rare", "Seldom", "Often", "Very Often")
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
bar5 <- barplot(k4$amateur, names.arg = rownames(k4),
        main = "Amateur Gear Usage",
        xlab = "Type of Gear", 
        cex.names = 0.6, 
        cex.axis = 0.6, 
        las = 1, 
        ylim = c(0,4), 
        horiz = FALSE,
        width = 1,
        yaxt = "n"
        )
axis(2, at = 1:4, labels = bar5lab, tick = FALSE, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.6)
# text(bar5, amateur, label = amateur, pos = 3, cex = 0.80, col = "red")

bar6 <- barplot(k4$professional, names.arg = rownames(k4),
        main = "Professional Gear Usage", 
        xlab = "Type of Gear", 
        cex.names = 0.6, 
        cex.axis = 0.6, 
        las = 1, 
        ylim = c(0,4), 
        horiz = FALSE,
        width = 1,
        yaxt = "n"
        )
axis(2, at = 1:4, labels = bar5lab, tick = FALSE, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.6)
# text(bar6, professional, label = professional, pos = 3, cex = 0.80, col = "red")
```

What about the use of protective gear? Responses were tabulated on a scale of 0 to 4, 0 meaning "I never use gear," and 4 being "I use gear very often."

## Kauther's fifth table

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
k5s <- k5[-1,]
xyplot(k5s$td_loss ~ k5s$td_loss_overuse, groups = rownames(k5s),
       ylim = c(0, 4200),
       ylab = "Total Loss of Training Days",
       xlim = c(0, 15),
       xlab = "Loss of Training Days per Injury",
       main = "Loss of Training Days (Totals & per Injury)",
panel = function(x, y) {
      panel.xyplot(x, y, abline = c(0, 1), subscripts = TRUE, 
      groups = rownames(k5s))
      ltext(x = k5s$td_loss_overuse, y = k5s$td_loss, 
      labels = rownames(k5s), pos = 4, cex = 1)
      })
```

Taking a look at loss of training days by anatomical injury leaves me a bit frightened. Of the 144 bboys, the highest losses of total training days occurred with knee injuries, spine injuries, and wrist/hand injuries. When normalized to lost training days per injury, a knee injury could take a bboy out for approximately two weeks, wrist/hand injuries for approximately a week and a half, and surprisingly, spine, shoulder or elbow injuries, one entire week (only?!?).
