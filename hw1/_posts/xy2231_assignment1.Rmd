This is my first Rmarkdown trail!

I will plot some graphes using **Donation-Disease** dataset

```{r}
setwd('~/_posts')
dat <- read.table('Donation-Disease.csv')
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
