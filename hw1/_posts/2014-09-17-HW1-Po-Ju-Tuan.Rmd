This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
attach(cars)
cars
View(cars)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.6,colour="black", fill="white")

ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed)) + geom_density()

ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth=.6,colour="black", fill="white")+
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666")
  
```
