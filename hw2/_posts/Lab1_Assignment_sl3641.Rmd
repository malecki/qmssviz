## The following function will load packages required for this tutorial.
## If a package cannot be found in your instance of Rstudio...
## ... it will be installed automatically. 
## Don't worry about how to write functions quite yet, we will introduce that later
## But do run the following code:

load_install<-function(lib){
  if(! require(lib, character.only=TRUE)) install.packages(lib, character.only=TRUE)
  library(lib, character.only=TRUE)
}

## the required libraries (e.g. packages)
Thelib<-c("knitr", "plyr", "ggplot2", "reshape2")

## apply the function
lapply(Thelib, load_install)
```

```{r import_data}
# Nigeria facility inventory
getwd()
sample_data <- read.csv("../sample_health_facilities.csv")

str(sample_data)
head(sample_data)
```

Mini-Assignment
1. Go to this link and download the file into the working directory
2. Product a new data.frame, which has the following properties
    + From the Nigeria Facilities Inventory data (sample_data from section 1.5.1), select all facilities located in the Southern zones of Nigeria.
```{r op1}
newdata <- sample_data[sample_data$zone%in%c("South-South", "Southeast", "Southwest"),]

# - Incorporate the pop2006 column from the lgas.csv file into the new data.frame containing only those facilities located in Southern Nigeria. (Hint: your id column is lga_id).
lgas <- read.csv("../lgas.csv")
lgas2 <- lgas[, c("lga_id", "pop_2006")]

newdata2 <- merge(newdata, lgas2, by="lga_id")

# - Calculate the total number of full time nurses and doctors for all health facilities in each state.
?aggregate
total_nurses <- aggregate(num_nurses_fulltime~state, data=newdata2, sum, na.rm=FALSE)
colnames(total_nurses) <- c("state", "total_nurses")
newdata3 <- merge(newdata2, total_nurses, by="state", all=TRUE)

total_doctors <- aggregate(num_doctors_fulltime ~ state, data=newdata2, sum, na.rm=FALSE)
colnames(total_doctors) <- c("state", "total_doctors")
newdata4 <- merge(newdata3, total_doctors, by="state")

# - Sort the resulting dataset by state population, in descending order.
newdata5 <- newdata4[order(newdata4$pop_2006, decreasing=TRUE),]
row.names(newdata5) <- NULL
```

```{r show_results}
# - Show the results!
head(newdata5)
```
