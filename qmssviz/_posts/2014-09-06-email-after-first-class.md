Hi all &mdash; 

1. Admin detail: the class is, for space (ﬁre code) reasons, capped at 45. We’ve admitted people from the wait list with a preference for QMSS students, because it is a QMSS class. Hopefully by the end of drop/add on Friday (after the second class) everyone who wants to be here will be. If you’re registered and need some paperwork signed bring it on Thursday. Email or talk to me on Thursday about any other administrivia. 
2. The [course site](http://malecki.github.io/qmssviz/) / [syllabus](http://malecki.github.io/qmssviz/intro.html)
  - I pushed tag ‘v1.0’ immediately before class on Thursday. To the extent a syllabus is a contract, v1.0 is that.
  - The [weekly schedule](http://malecki.github.io/qmssviz/agenda.html) will probably change. In the future, you can diff [this file](https://github.com/malecki/qmssviz/blob/gh-pages/_data/agenda.yaml) against v1.0.
3. The slides from Thursday are under ‘blog & slides’ [on the page](http://malecki.github.io/qmssviz/2014/09/04/intro/); or, more simply, rendered [inline]( https://github.com/malecki/qmssviz/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2014-09-04-intro.md). You will obviously find it in your fork of the repo (see below). (Some results from our technical questionnaire are also there, by the way.)
4. There is both an &#39;after class&#39; section and some reading for next week. See the [agenda](http://malecki.github.io/qmssviz/agenda.html). In particular: get a Github account and fork the repository. Please be sure to add the main one as "upstream" (`git remote add upstream git@github.com:malecki/qmssviz.git`)
5. I took the liberty of adding everyone from SSOL to Piazza. Courseworks has a little bit of stuff on it but is [deprecated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation) for this class.


That's all for now, I think. Have a good rest of the weekend.

&mdash;Malecki
