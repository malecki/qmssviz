# Daily Organization #

The data structure for each class meeting below is a **class** section with a rough plan for what we intend to do with our meeting time; and other sections (not necessarily all of them every time) for items to **read before** (or watch in the case of video links); **due in class** for assignments that are due at the start of class (because they will be the subject of discussion in class) and **do after class**.

Two hours a week is not a large amount of time for a developer to spend in meetings, rather than coding, reading, or doing other stuff. We will use some of this time like development meetings: going over specifications (assignments), making tasks (writing down acceptance criteria), having detailed code reviews of various forms, and discussing blocking issues and potential solutions.

You should be prepared at any class to give a very brief summary of your status on all the projects you're working on. Knowing *and alerting others* that you are stuck on something is vital.
