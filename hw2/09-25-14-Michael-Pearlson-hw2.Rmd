MDRC Sample Code
========================================================
```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop")
data <- read.csv("lgas.csv")
hf<- read.csv("sample_health_facilities.csv")
```

First, I grabbed all of the southern areas using `grep()` as well as the *pop_2006* variable from the other data set.  Then I merged both of these new data frames by the id *lga_id*.  

```{r}
south.data <- hf[grep("South", hf$zone),]
pop_2006 <- data[,c(1,3)]
nd <- merge(south.data, pop_2006, by = "lga_id")
```

To answer the questions regarding the  number of full time doctors and nurses I aggregated by state.

```{r}
aggregate(num_doctors_fulltime~ state, data = nd, sum)
aggregate(num_nurses_fulltime ~ state, data = nd, sum)
```

Finally, I ordered the dataset by population after aggregating by state.
```{r}
bystate <- aggregate(pop_2006 ~ state, data = nd, sum)
final <- merge(nd, bystate, by = "state")
names(final)[names(final)=="pop_2006.y"] <- "statepop"
final.sort <- final[order(-final$statepop),]
```

```{r}
aggregate(num_doctors_fulltime ~ state,data = nd, sum)
aggregate(num_nurses_fulltime ~ state,data = nd, sum)
```
