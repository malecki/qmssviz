This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Set Work Directory
setwd("~/Downloads")
install.packages("foreign")
library(foreign)
data=read.spss("WV4_Data_spss_v_2014-04-28.sav")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
